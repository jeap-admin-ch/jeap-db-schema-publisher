    shortDescription: Publishes a jEAP application's DB schema to the jEAP Architecture Repository Service at startup.
    longDescription: >
      jEAP DB Schema Publisher is a library based on Spring Boot to publish the DB schema of a jEAP application to the
      jEAP Architecture Repository Service.

      * If activated by providing a valid `jeap.archrepo.url` property, it will
         automatically publish the DB schema to the jEAP Architecture Repository Service.
      * The request to the Archrepo service will be authenticated using OAuth2. By default, an oauth client registration named
        `archrepo-client` is expected to be configured under `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration`.
      * The DB schema will be read and published at application startup, on a best-effort basis. The DB schema upload
         process is designed to have the least possible impact on application, i.e. it will not block the application or
         cause startup to fail if the upload fails.
    features:
      - Automatically publishes the DB schema of a microservice to the Archrepo service on application startup
      - Non-blocking, best-effort schema upload to avoid startup delays or failures
